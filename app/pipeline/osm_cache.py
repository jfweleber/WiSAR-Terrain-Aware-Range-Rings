# Module:       pipeline/osm_cache.py
# Purpose:      Local OSM cache fallback for when all public Overpass endpoints
#               fail during an analysis. Reads pre-built state-level extracts
#               from a GeoPackage file that is refreshed weekly by a cron job
#               (see tools/build_osm_cache.py).
#
#               The cache mirrors the feature categories downloaded by
#               download_osm_features(): trails, roads, waterways, powerlines.
#               It is used ONLY as a last resort when live Overpass is
#               unreachable — up-to-the-minute OSM data is always preferred.

    the cache can't help — and we must tell the user that rather than silently
    returning empty GeoDataFrames that look identical to "OSM just had no data
    for this area."

    We compare against the cache's recorded bbox envelope. This is a loose
    check — it treats the cache extent as a single rectangle, so a bbox that
    falls inside the envelope but outside any covered state (e.g., in
    eastern Oregon if we only cache CA) would still pass. That's acceptable
    because the consequence is "returned empty results from the cache" which
    is indistinguishable from "no features in that area" and degrades
    gracefully.

    as the live path (keys: trails, roads, waterways, powerlines) so no
    other code needs to branch on cache-vs-live.

    Each GeoPackage layer has an RTree spatial index built during cache
    construction, so the bbox clip is near-instant even though the source
    layer may contain hundreds of thousands of features spanning five
